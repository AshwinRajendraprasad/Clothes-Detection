## Clothing detection using YOLOv3 nad DeepFashion2 dataset.

- YOLOV3 trained with DeepFashion2 dataset: https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2 

- Trained with Darknet framework: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

- To do inference use a pytorch implementation of YOLOv3: https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3.

- The trained model weights are at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-_ctjNtIWLhhLsqwYQzPUNCzh4U1coq/view?usp=sharing. The model was trained with 15000 iterations.

# Coming soon:

- Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet models.
